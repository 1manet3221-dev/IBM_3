# **App Name**: IBM

## Core Features:

- Live Data Visualization: Display real-time IoT sensor data streams (heart rate, EMG, skin temperature/GSR).
- IoT Data Ingestion: Ingest asynchronous IoT data streams from multiple sensors (heart rate, EMG, skin temperature/GSR).
- Lightweight Edge Models: Run multiple lightweight models (SVM, TinyML NN, gradient-boosted) for stress, activity, and fatigue prediction.
- Adaptive Model Fusion: The Gemini LLM uses a tool to dynamically assign weights to predictions from different models based on context and historical performance.
- Digital Twin Personalization: Maintain a digital twin, tracking individual physiological baselines and patterns using the LLM.
- Contextualized Narrative Reasoning: Synthesize a holistic insight from the weighted model predictions and the user's digital twin.
- Individual Prediction Display: Display the predictions from each lightweight model alongside the synthesized narrative.
- Implement MegaETH-Testnet: Implement MegaETH-Testnet for blockchain and walletconnect with top3 wallet providers user will choose n the https://chainlist.org/chain/6342 this is the RPC note it

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Indigo (#6F00FF) for a cutting-edge, intelligent feel.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F5) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright Cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight important data and insights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, objective, and neutral look.
- Use crisp, minimalist icons to represent sensor data and insights.
- Design a modular layout for clear separation and prioritization of data streams, model outputs, and LLM narratives.
- Subtle animations to reflect data changes and model updates in real time.
